# Data-Engineering-Project

The dataset includes information about 1,000 products across several categories such as electronics, apparel, food & home, books, toys & games, and more. Each product entry contains details on price, rating, stock quantity, number of reviews, discounts, sales, and the date of inventory addition. This comprehensive dataset provides a rich source of data for analysis and research.

Businesses can leverage tools like Pandas, NumPy, and visualization libraries such as Matplotlib to conduct in-depth analyses. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), they can uncover key insights into popular product categories, top-selling items, pricing trends, and seasonal variations. Visualization techniques can help create intuitive graphs and charts to effectively communicate these findings.

In summary, this dataset is a versatile and valuable resource for studying e-commerce trends, understanding consumer behavior, and driving business growth. By efficiently utilizing this dataset, businesses can gain actionable insights, optimize operations, and stay competitive in todayâ€™s dynamic e-commerce landscape.

## Dataset

The dataset we chose for this project was retrieved from Kaggle. We implemented the use of Pandas, SQLite, and Seaborn to analyze the data in depth. We chose SQLite as the database to house our information and Seaborn as the visualization library to explore and analyze the dataset.

### SQLite

SQLite is chosen for its simplicity and ease of use, suitable for small to medium-scale projects like this:

**Advantages:**
- Lightweight and embedded within the application.
- No server setup is required, suitable for single-user access.
- Ideal for prototyping and smaller datasets.

**Considerations:**
- Not suitable for high concurrency or large-scale applications.
- Limited built-in security features compared to client-server databases.

## ETL Workflow

1. **Extract:**
   - Load `e-commerce_data.csv` into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Transform:**
   - Clean data (handle missing values, data types).
   - Calculate total sales by category.
   - Calculate average price by product.

3. **Load:**
   - Connect to SQLite database (`ecommerce.db`).
   - Create tables and load transformed data.

## Additional Library

Seaborn is a powerful visualization library in Python that builds on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. In this project, we used Seaborn to create various visualizations to better understand and present the data.

## Ethical Considerations

### Data Privacy
The dataset used in this project was carefully reviewed to ensure it does not contain any personally identifiable information (PII). Any sensitive information that could identify individuals was anonymized or removed before analysis.

### Data Security
Data security measures were implemented to protect the data from unauthorized access. The dataset was stored in a secure database with encryption and access controls.

### Data Accuracy
Data cleaning and validation steps were performed to ensure the accuracy and quality of the data. Assumptions and transformations made during the analysis are documented in the ETL process.

### Bias and Fairness
The dataset was analyzed for potential biases, and efforts were made to minimize bias. Fairness-aware techniques were employed to ensure that the results do not discriminate against any group.

### Transparency
The ETL process and data analysis methods are detailed to ensure transparency. This includes descriptions of data sources, transformation steps, and algorithms used.

### Consent and Compliance
The data used in this project was collected with proper consent and complies with relevant data protection regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA. Necessary permissions were obtained for using third-party data.

### Impact on Stakeholders
The potential impact of the analysis on various stakeholders was considered. Efforts were made to use the insights gained from the study to improve customer experience and business practices ethically.

### Intellectual Property
All third-party tools, libraries, and datasets used in this project are acknowledged and cited. Compliance with the licensing terms of these resources was ensured.

### Automated Decisions
Checks and balances were implemented for any automated decision-making processes to ensure fairness and prevent unintended negative consequences. Human oversight was maintained for critical decisions.

## Conclusions

The e-commerce data analysis project, which involved extracting, transforming, and loading data into a relational database, has provided valuable insights into various aspects of the e-commerce business. Here are the key conclusions drawn from the project:

- **Data Cleaning:** The initial dataset contained missing values which were appropriately handled. Converting 'DateAdded' to datetime format and ensuring numerical data types for columns like 'Price' and 'Sales' improved the dataset's reliability.
- **Database Choice:** SQLite was chosen for its simplicity and ease of integration with Python. It is well-suited for this project, which involves analyzing a moderate amount of data.
- **Database Design:** The database was designed with two main tables: transactions and products. This separation allows for efficient querying and better organization of the data.
- **Top Products by Sales:** Identifying the top 10 products by total sales helped highlight the best-performing products in the e-commerce store.
- **Top Categories by Sales:** Understanding which categories generate the most sales can guide business decisions related to product offerings and category expansions.
- **Average Price Analysis:** Analyzing the average price per product and per category provides information on pricing strategies and customer spending patterns.
- **Seaborn Visualizations:** Using Seaborn, various visualizations were created to represent the data insights visually. These visualizations include bar plots for top products and categories by sales, and average price by product and category. These plots enhance understanding and communication of the data insights.

While SQLite is suitable for this project, larger datasets and higher concurrency might necessitate a more robust database system such as PostgreSQL or MySQL. 

### Future Work

- **Real-Time Data Processing:** Implementing real-time data processing and analysis could offer more timely insights, crucial for dynamic business environments.
- **Scalability:** Larger datasets and higher concurrency might necessitate a more robust database system such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Incorporating more advanced analytics, such as predictive modeling and customer segmentation, could provide deeper insights and drive more strategic decisions.

## Summary

This project successfully demonstrated how to extract, transform, and load e-commerce data into a relational database, perform meaningful analyses, and visualize the results. The insights gained from this analysis can help improve product management, marketing strategies, and overall business operations. The attention to ethical consideration ensures that the project was conducted responsibly, respecting data privacy, security, and fairness.

By leveraging the power of data analysis and visualization, businesses can make more informed decisions, optimize their operations, and better meet the needs of their customers. This project serves as a foundational step towards more advanced and impactful data-driven strategies in e-commerce.
